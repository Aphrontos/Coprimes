Generate a PNG based on Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progression.

Code uses Python's zlib, and is ridiculously slow. Use if you have the patience.

A PNG named "Pattern.png" will be generated in the same directory where you put the Python code.

You can specify the dimensions, height then width.

Note: a 1920 by 1080 PNG takes ~10-15 minutes to generate on my laptop. You've been warned for the 2nd time.
