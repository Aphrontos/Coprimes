# Coprimes

## Description
Euclid's orchard is an infinite 2D structure, where the 'trees' are on lattice points whose coordinates are coprime.

## Motivation
I just felt curious what will happen and how it would look like. 

I'm also a fan of odd wallpapers, especially if they're generated using a mathematical concepts.
